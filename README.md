NextLeg is an idea of finding the best alternative flight options during the hurricane season

NextLeg is an idea I came up with after a frustrating travel experience during the hurricane season. In August 2024, I had a flight to Las Vegas for a major conference, but it got canceled because of a hurricane. I was stuck in Philadelphia for a whole day, feeling panicked and lost. The line at the airlineâ€™s customer service desk was incredibly long, and it took me three hours just to speak with a representative.

When I finally got to the front, most people were being told their next available flights were in two or three days. I explained my situation and asked if there were any connecting flights that could get me out of Philadelphia, even if it meant stopping somewhere else first. The system took a long time to find options, and the best one available was a 24-hour trip with three stops. I eventually made it to Las Vegas on time, but the whole process left me exhausted.

That experience gave me the idea for NextLeg, a tool that helps travelers quickly find the fastest, cheapest, and most efficient connecting flights during disruptions like hurricanes. I took charge of the data side of the project, built the database from scratch, and developed several machine learning models to predict whether a flight is likely to be canceled.
